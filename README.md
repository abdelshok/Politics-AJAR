Online platform that leverages the ProPublica and Maplight APIs to analyze congress-people's voting history and the identity of the companies lobbying for the passage of individual bills to infer the stance of each congress person on a set of social issues, such as environmental conservation or foreign policy, in order to allow American voters to determine their ideal candidate.

## Live version

The application is not live anymore. It was created as the final project for [FullStack Academy](https://www.fullstackacademy.com/), the bootcamp that I attended before I was accepted into graduate school.

It is now 2020 and judging by the current situation, it might be a good idea to pick up this project and really improve it.
